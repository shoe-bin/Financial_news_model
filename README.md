# Earnings Prediction Using AlphaVantage

This project aims to predict whether a company will outperform or underperform its earnings report using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Using data pulled from the AlphaVantage API, this project collects earnings reports and news articles for the 10 days leading up to each earnings release. NLP techniques like CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, and VADER Sentiment Analysis are used to extract meaningful features from this data. These features are then used as input for machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and SVM, to classify earnings performance as "outperform" or "underperform."
